## Mid Term Project

The students can decide on their Midterm project to work on one of these two options:
1. Modeling project: Real estate modeling project (see the project folder). You can work on another project that you choose.
2. Business Intelligence Project: Olist Business Intellegince Project(see the project folder). 

You can also work on another project of your own choice. In that case you let us know about the the data set and the objective of the analysis.

### Rules:
- Group of maximum of two people per project. Eventhough it is not recommended, you can work alone on the project.
- Every team has 12 minutes(7 minutes presentation plus 5 minutes Q&A).
- Every team should prepare a well-documented and organised presentation. Although presenting only a Jupyter Notebook is acceptable, we encourage you to prepare additional slides for better story telling experience.
- by the end of Monday we need you to submit a general plan for your project. To do this, first please create a new Github repository dedicated for the midterm project containing a readme file. The readme should be brief (half page or max 1 page) containing the following. Please don't forget to submit the URL to your project repository on the student portal. 
- The readme file should contains:
     + Members of the group
     + Goal of the project, what you want to achieve. Please specify if it is a modelling or BI project
     + Brief description of the dataset (Source, Number of rows, number of features)
     + High-level Planning of the project, e.g:
         - Day 1 - EDA
         - Day 2 - Clean the data
           - Remove typos of
           - Correct datatypes
           - ...
        - Day 3 
          - Transform the data
          - Scale Numerical Features
          - Encode Categorical Features
          - ...
        - Day 4 - Modelling
          - Split data
          - ...
          - Etc

Notes:
- Please when choosing the data set for your project, please make sure to explore and investigate the data first to check if it is useful for your analysis. For instance:
  +  checking the number of rows(preferrably in thousands of observations)
  +  you need to check if it is full of missing values or not,
  +  checking the data type of the target variable(in case of modeling project)
  +  Also  in case of multiple tables or csv files, make sure that the data is joinable( meaning having matching keys to join the data between these tables).
  +  (for the modeling project) Important: checking if the target variable is a continuous(numerical) variable(then it is a regression task)  or it is discrete(categorical) then it is a classification task. 
  +  (for the BI project), you dont need to include every single chart you could think of, you have to prioritize the most important patterns/insights that add value to the end user and helps you in telling the data story.
